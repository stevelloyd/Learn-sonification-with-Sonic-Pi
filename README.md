# Learn resource—‘sonification’ with Sonic Pi
## Listening to the weather

If you haven’t heard of [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) yet, it’s a brilliant sound synthesiser which runs on the Pi. It can support the learning of computing and also music.

This resource is about using Sonic Pi to ‘visualise’ data using sound; there’s a fancy name for this ‘sonification’. The aim is to use Sonic Pi, with help from another software package which is alo part of the standard Pi Raspbian software—_Mathematica_ to take weather (temperature) data and turn it into sound . Why do this? The ear is very sensitive to changes, and can pick out trends in data which might not be immediately apparent just by looking at a sequence of numbers.

## What do I need?

To undertake this you will need:

- a Raspberry Pi model B/B+ with speakers (for example those in the TV you’re using as a display) or headphones plugged into the audio socket
- an internet connection, so the Pi can download data
- a kettle, or other means of making a beverage, during the long process of Step 2 of the [worksheet](https://github.com/stevelloyd/Learn-sonification-with-Sonic-Pi/blob/master/worksheet.md)

This resource is a re-working of an earlier blog post—[Hearing the weather-sonification in Sonic Pi](http://stevelloyd.net/notes/2014/06/23/hearing-the-weather-sonification-in-sonic-pi/) with modifications to suit Mathematica 10 now in Raspbian (version of [ NOOBS 1.3.10](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)).
